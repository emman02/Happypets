        <h4>Pet</h4>
        <p>Pets provide their owners (or guardians) physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can supply both the human and pet with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to elderly adults who do not have adequate
            social interaction with other people, as well as to other people who are living alone.</p>

        <h4>Cage</h4>
        <p> Pet crates are designed to replicate a pet's natural den and as such can provide them with a place of refuge at home or when traveling to new surroundings. Crate training accustoms the dog/cat with the crate. The most common reasons for using
            a pet crate are for toilet training a new puppy or kitten, taking a pet on short trips inside the car, displaying them at a pet show, or giving a pet a place to go when visitors come to the house.</p>
